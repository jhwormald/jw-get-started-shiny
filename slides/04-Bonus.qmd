## R Markdown and Quarto


For both of these document types (when using html) it is possible to embed Shiny widgets or even entire Shiny apps.

These documents are inherently less portable (no longer possible to just share the html file) but they allow for interactivity.

This is enable by including the following in the document's YAML,

::: columns
::: {.column width="47%"}
R Markdown

```yaml
---
output: html_document
runtime: shiny
---
```
:::

::: {.column width="5%"}
:::

::: {.column width="47%"}
Quarto

```yaml
---
format: html
server: shiny
