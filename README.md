# Introduction to Shiny

## What will I learn?

Shiny is an R package that makes it easy to build interactive web apps straight from R. This workshop will start at the beginning: designing and creating user interfaces, learning and mastering the reactive model that connects your R code to the interface, and deploying apps publicly and privately. Then we'll work with intermediate-level tools: communicating with outside files and databases, debugging, modularizing. You'll build a range of (closely related) app formats in wide use: interactive Rmd, browser based apps, tutorials, and dashboards. In the end, you'll be a confident Shiny user, able to design interactive apps to achieve your purpose and produce a polished and professional implementation.

## Should I take the course?

You should be comfortable with the basics of R, such as writing functions, indexing vectors and lists, debugging simple errors, and working with data structures like data frames.

Your (lack of) previous experience with Shiny is not an issue. If you have experience, you'll see things in a new way. If you don't, we'll get you started on the right footing.
